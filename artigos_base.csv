This has led to the advancement in science and technology. Many surveys show that network intrusion has registered a consistent increase and lead to personal privacy theft and has become a major platform for attack in the recent years. Network intrusion is any unauthorized activity on a computer network. Hence there is a need to develop an effective intrusion detection system. In this paper we acquaint an intrusion detection system that uses improved genetic k-means algorithm(IGKM) to detect the type of intrusion. This paper also shows a comparison between an intrusion detection system that uses the k-means++ algorithm and an intrusion detection system that uses IGKM algorithm while using smaller subset of kdd-99 dataset with thousand instances and the KDD-99 dataset. The experiment shows that the intrusion detection that uses IGKM algorithm is more accurate when compared to k-means++ algorithm.","","978-1-5386-5314-2978-1-5386-5315","10.1109/ICACCI.2018.8554710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554710","Internet;Network Intrusion;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Detection System;IGKM algorithm;k-means++ algorithm;KDD-99","Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms;Training;Genetics;Time complexity;Partitioning algorithms","computer network security;data privacy;genetic algorithms;Internet;pattern clustering","IGKM algorithm;network intrusion detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;genetic k-means algorithm;IGKM;KDD-99 dataset;personal privacy theft","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach is an extension of the intrusion detection approach using GNP, so it can detect and distinguish normal, known intrusion and unknown intrusion. The simulation result shows that the detection rate is improved compared with traditional intrusion detection approach, and normal, known intrusion and unknown intrusion are distinguished with high accuracy.","","978-4-907764-34-0978-4-907764-33","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335129","network intrusion detection;class association rule mining;Genetic Network Programming","Intrusion detection;Genetics;Association rules;Economic indicators;Data mining;Computer networks;Protection;Databases;Mathematical programming;Production systems","genetic algorithms;security of data","misuse detection;anomaly detection;genetic network programming;class association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;normal intrusion;known intrusion;unknown intrusion","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Unsupervised outlier detection technique for intrusion detection in cloud computing","M. Kumar; R. Mathur","School of Computer Engineering, Lovely Professional University, India; School of Computer Engineering, Lovely Professional University, India","International Conference for Convergence for Technology-2014","","2014","","","1","4","Outlier detection is becoming a recent area of research focus in data mining. Here we are proposing an efficient outlier detection concept DenOD (Density Based Outlier Detection) based on unsupervised method for intrusion detection in cloud computing environment. Unsupervised outlier detection techniques are playing big role in a various application domains such as network intrusion detection, fault detection and fraud detection. The beauty of unsupervised method is that, it does not require any training data set or any kind of previous knowledge. This technique can help to detect accurate and novel attacks without any previous knowledge. DenOD will implement on IDCC (Intrusion Detection in Cloud Computing) framework that has three components- Cloud nodes, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and End User. This technique is capable to detect all kind of attacks as well as detect faulty services in cloud environment.","","978-1-4799-3759-2978-1-4799-3758","10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092027","Intrusion Detection System;Fault Detection;DenOD;IDCC;Cloud Computing;Unsupervised Method;IDS;Outlier Detection Technique","Intrusion detection;Cloud computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Computers;Real-time systems","cloud computing;security of data","unsupervised outlier detection technique;DenOD;density-based outlier detection;attack detection;IDCC framework;intrusion detection-in-cloud computing framework;cloud nodes;IDS;intrusion detection system;end users;faulty service detection","","1","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
